                yeah ,yeah. I know, I am still a teenager. You must be thinking who the hell are you to write this article,huh? Dude, I will write this anyhow. tolerate me. piliz.

                <b>1. Status updates for everything.</b>
                <br/>
                This ranks number one as it pisses me off the most. From waking up to moving to bed, there are people whose life resides in statuses. You had pizza today evening, fine. What's the point in  posting pictures of it  at different angles? A veg pizza won't become a chicken pizza when captured via different angle.

                <b>2.Procatinating</b>
                <br/>
                Hmm. Let me enjoy today, will do that work tomorrow. wolla, this tomorrow never came and will never come.
                You know the rest. ;)
                <br/><br/>
                <b>3. Using  'fuck' often</b>
                <br/>
                Since fuck is a slang in english,it feel cool. right? Wrong. Meaning of the word is not going to change. Frequent use of this word is not going to make you 'fucking gentleman'.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>4.Wasting time on social media</b>
                <br/>
                Even I was addicted to social media once. I know what it feels like. Social media is a big fat lie. The girl you stalk because of her perfect photos has beauty plus installed in her mobile, all the smiling faces you see have a sad face behind them. Social media is misguiding dude!
                <br/><br/>
                <b>5.Useless showing off</b>
                <br/>
                Ah, it's not called showing off, it's called trend, I guess. Posting pictures of brand new adidas,nike products or Fb update stating 'bought new bla bla phone' .Cool. Do these companies pay you for their promotion or it is some charity work you do for these poor companies?huh?
