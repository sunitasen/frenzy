            hellllooo!<br/>
                We can't express how much we feel delighted to have you here!<br/>
                You seriously wanna know who are the people behind, huh?<br/><br/>
                We are a team of pscho patients, whom their parents disowned.And we are 
                earning our bread-and-butter via this blog.<br/>
                <b>For your esteemed knowledge, the above paragraph is all rubbish!</b><br/><br/>
                We are normal teenagers, oscillating between exams and our passion(duh!)<br/>
                You must have come across someone like us.<br/>The girl you looked at the metro and
                thought,'ugh! she is a mess', or , the girl you saw in a bus and admired her beauty , else ,
                the girl whom you friend-zoned, even if not her , then we are one of those hundreds of faces you observe every single day and ignore!
                <br/>
                Still confused? Go and stand infront of the mirror.
